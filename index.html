<h1>Helen Chu's first website!</h1>

<h2>Problems I exprienced</h2>
<p>The header and paragraph went along pretty smoothly, except for when I accidentally put \p instead of /p at the end of the paragraph. <br /> I had more trouble with placing an asset on the website. I wanted to put a picture of my roomate's cat, so I started off with img src="dizzy.jpg"/ and it just didn't work. I then added helenchu/ infront of dizzy, which was a step closer to success, but still not there. <br /> then, I realized that it is case sensitive, so I changed dizzy.jpg into dizzy.JPG, and at this point it worked! The picture showed up on the website just fine. I then tried to resize it since the picture was too big, but this step somehow messed up my code. Realizing that the picture's not showing anymore, I tried to revert my code back to when it has not been resized, but this time it is refusing to show my picture, even if I tried to copy and paste the exact same code from the version when it worked. Finally, I gave up to fate and decided to insert a hyperlink of google image search for keyword "cat" for the sake of my sanity, since I've re-tried so many times. I will continue to try and see what's the problem for images!</p>
